## Briefs for each stage

### ðŸ”´ Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### ðŸŸ¡ Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### ðŸŸ¢ Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### ðŸ”µ Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### ðŸŸ£ Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

**stage one:**
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

in regards to the unconventional representation of time i wanted to explore the lifecycle of a star from birth to death.

the cycle goes as follows:
1. a nebulas - which is a cloud of gases and dust that is being condensed by gravity
2. main sequence star - otherwise known as supermassive  and has a stable core - it then expands and gets hotter - 90% of its life time
3. a red supergiant is then formed which has an unstable core and when that core implodes, collapses and bursts into a
4. supernova - freeing all elements created in its lifetime
5. whatâ€™s left of the star is a stellar black hole that has an intense gravitational pull

- the idea is that i will code a sequence of images to change in accordance to the life cycle of a star perhaps over a background of everchanging stars in a galaxy
- i ran into an issue when trying to make the sequence loop without deleting the background and the stars, i was also trying to figure out a way to delay the start of the star sequence without slowing down the gap currently between each star forming.
- the idea is that the little stars will show up, and then the 5 larger images will show up in succession along the line, and then they will disappear and loop again.
- after a lot of trial and error, i managed to find a way to achieve a similar result to what i was  initially looking for. 
- i tried to use the createGraphics function but in the end it seemed to be a little too ahrd for my current abilities.
- eventually i just decided to set up another counter that cleared the screen after 5 images showed up with a delay of two seconds, and then i put the star background into the draw function so it was always looping no matter what.
- this created an everchanging backdrop of stars alongside the cycle of planets which i honestly prefer to my original idea.
- i think this represents time due to the fact that stars can live for millions of years but they all follow a similar cycle no mattter what
- it's just a different type of lifecycle and explores the cosmos beyond us
